## The Plan of Becoming Professional Developer

---

üìù It has been two weeks since I completed my EDA Developer BootCamp training. This experience has changed me. I start to think a lot about things that I had never thought before. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed, just like a newborn fish diving into tech ocean. In this situation, an effective mindset is critical to keep me on right path.

***

  - To have a right mindset, I start with making a plan for this year. In this year, I want to achieve following goals:

  - Get a job, internships or work for the non-profit organization like Charity-It.

  - Regularly document my learning and project developing journey to have the more clear understanding of the technologies.

  - Regularly contribute to open source project.

  - Keep learning new technologies by working on the side project.

  - Go to Tech Meet Up to meet local tech community, learn and share knowledge

I need to remember this: there are lots of challenges, break them into small problems and solve them one by one. It is a perfect opportunity to learn.üí™
