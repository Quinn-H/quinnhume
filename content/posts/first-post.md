### The Motivations to Build a New Blog
As a Junior Developer, I spent almost half of my time in reading Tech Posts, the Stack Overflow or somethings to help me research and resolve problems during app development. However, reading is short term memory, and you could lose what you learned after few days or few hours if you do not keep using it. So this Blog is my way to overcome the problem.

### Static Website Generator
I had a basic HTML/CSS [learning blog](https://quinn-h.github.io/) host on GitHub page when I was in beginning of EDA BootCamp. It was painful to update content in a pure HTML/CSS page. So I did a little bit googling and Found **Static Website Generator** which you can post in Markdown. Here are some interesting posts talk about it:
- [An Introduction to Static Site Generators](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators)
- [Why Static Website Generators Are The Next Big Thing](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/)

There are many static website generators, the ones I prefer are those using React and Webpack
- [Gatsby.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)
- [Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/)

Finally, my choose is  **Phenomic** the reasons are:
- Nicer documentation
- Full control over your Webpack configuration
- Clean and good base themes

If you are not familiar with React, you can check out other static website generators [Here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/05/02/top-ten-static-website-generators/)
